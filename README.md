# Nofrendo

[![Build](https://github.com/JustMLC4real/nofrendo/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JustMLC4real/nofrendo/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This app is a [NES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System) emulator that runs on the [NumWorks calculator](https://www.numworks.com).

## Install the app

To install this app, you'll need to:
1. Download the latest `nofrendo.nwa` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/JustMLC4real/nofrendo/releases) page
2. Extract a `cartridge.nes` ROM dump from your NES cartridge, or, alternatively, use the provided [2048.nes](https://github.com/JustMLC4real/nofrendo/raw/master/src/2048.nes) file.
2. Head to [my.numworks.com/apps](https://my.numworks.com/apps) to send the `nwa` file on your calculator along the `nes` file.

## How to use the app

The controls are pretty obvious because the NES gamepad looks a lot like the NumWorks' keyboard:

|NES controls|NumWorks|
|-|-|
|Arrows|Arrows|
|B|Back|
|A|OK|
|Select|Shift|
|Start|Backspace|

## Build the app
